Round 4: versant test

Telephonic round where you have to answer a robots questions. Like you have to rrepeate a sentence , speak for 20 sec on a given topic.

Very simple stuff.

I have cleared all these rounds and now waiting for managerial round. Panels were not available that time so they asked me to wait till next week. Lets hope I clear that also.

1st Feb 2017: (Managerial Round)
Today i got call from HR for my Managerial Round . I have the option to take this from Home or from Deloitte office. I choose to attend this from home. It was a video conference call. HR shared the link for video Conferencing.

Basically they will ask you behavior question in this round. But some managers ask some technical question also so be prepared.

For me below question were asked :

tell me about your academics and employment.
Describe your role in current project .
What all design pattern i have worked with.
what is encapsulation .
what is interface and abstract class . When to use what.
What is your career aspiration.
Why Deloitte
Your Current CTC and Expected CTC
Do you have any questions.
I answered all of these questions. After some time i got a call from HR that i have cleared it. Will come back to you for further steps.

May be there is just a HR round left and it will be telephonic .

I will update the details once i received the call from them.

Thanks. and Best of Luck.

8th FEB 2017:

Ok so yesterday i got call from HR for 1 last time. She told me that i have successfully cleared all the rounds and we want to offer you . After that she asked me few questions like notice period , total exerience, expected ctc, why that much , location .

And day after that i got salary breakup mail from HR. They offered me more than what i have asked . The office formal letter they will send by next week.

So this is the complete story of me and deloitte . Hope this will help someone in future as i was also looking for detailed information about interview process.

The most important thing for deloitte is ur confident . If you answer them 70% with confidence and ur communication if above avg you can clear all these round.

Best of luck .!!!
